                <p>We developed Hashtag Inspector – a working Android app to check everything related to a Twitter hashtag –
                    within a 10-week time frame for a course at University of Bremen. It shows all the real-time trending
                    hashtag, relevant hashtags and tweets to the selected hashtag, and the overall sentiment of the hashtag.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Thanks to the precise ad curation on social media nowadays, my Facebook newsfeed was full of articles
                    and marketing materials about SEO (search-engine optimization), especially about keyword research
                    tools and platforms, after I had a deep-talk with a friend about it. In a nutshell, the tool
                    provides insights into how a keyword is performing on search engines like Google or Youtube.
                    Interestingly, the tool also shows a list of suggested keywords relevant to the entered keyword,
                    which triggered my curiosity: “How did the algorithm figure out that these keywords are relevant to
                    one another?”</p>
                <img src="images/hashtag_keyword-seo-tool.jpg" alt="Keyword Tool">
                <p>On the same day, I was talking to my friend about the like-baiting strategies of influencers, and one
                    of the effective ways is to bully the hashtag system using a lot of hashtags relevant or similar to
                    one another. I, once again, asked myself, “Is there an algorithm to browse all the keywords that are
                    relevant to each other?” </p>
                <p>I, with those questions in my mind, scribbled and doodled out an algorithm to gather hashtags
                    relevant to a hashtag, and it turned out to be simpler than I expected.</p>

            <section id="system-design">
                <h2>System Design</h2>
                <p>Considering the amount of time we had, we decided to stick to the MVP and keep it as simple as
                    possible:</p>

                <img src="images/hashtag_system-architecture-dark.png" alt="Architecture" class="dark-img">
                <p>The back-end of the app consists of a Twitter API (Twitter4j, to query tweets), a sentiment analysis
                    module (Microsoft Text Analytics, to detect the sentiment of the queried tweets), and a database
                    (SQLite) to store the previous queries. </p>
            </section>

            <section id="interface-design">
                <h2>Interface Design</h2>
                <p>Although the UI was not the focus of the course and we didn't want to spend too much time on making
                    it fancy, I still decided to go with a proper design workflow and quickly created the pixel-perfect
                    mock-up in less than half an hour. The color scheme was that from Twitter - at least we didn’t use
                    the default green-y color scheme!</p>
                <img src="images/hashtag_interfaces.png" alt="UI Showcase">
                <p>I tested the mock-up with a couple of friends and received really positive feedback, yet still had
                    the chance to discover quite a few possible improvements that I can make to the UI.</p>
                <p>According to most of the testers, the first element they looked at was the circular search button on
                    the bottom of the screen, which was supposed to be disabled at first and will only be enabled once
                    the user has entered something in the search field on the top of the screen. The search field –
                    which was expected to catch the first attention – became the most voted second-choice. The detail
                    was not that much of an irritation, but if a problem is discovered and it doesn’t take that much
                    time to fix, why wouldn’t I tackle it?</p>
                <p>I, then, decided to “enable” the search button right from the beginning, and its function in that
                    state was to change the state of the search field to “focused”. Once there is something in the
                    search field, the search button will redirect the user to the search result. As a result, the most
                    highlighted element was then clickable, which not only met the user’s expectations and intentions
                    but also kept the user flow unchanged.</p>
